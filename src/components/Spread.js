    <p> 
      Tarot card spreads allow us to view multiple aspects of a question or situatuion at
      once and their connecitons. The positioning of each card in a tarot spread helps define the meaning
      of that card, and each card represents a facet of your experience. These facets can be anything
      be anything from "influences form the recent past" to "my heart in my relationship" to
      "what I need to let go of". By showing us many facets of our life at once, spreads allow us
      to zoom out and get a big-picture look at our lives or at a particualar situation.

      The 3-Card Tarot Spread is used by tarot beginners and professionals alike.
      Sure, the 10-card Celtic Cross spread is sexy and seems more “professional,” but a simple 3-card tarot spread can give you all the information you need, 
      no matter what problem you are having.
