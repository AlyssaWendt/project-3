  limitlessness, the 78 crads themselves came about within our finite, limited world. The 
  timeless characters, themes and inmages were recieved, developed and analyzed by people belonging 
  to a particular moments in history, which both limited and inspired them.

    <h3>Origins</h3>
    <p>The ancestors of what we today know as Tarot cards can be traced back to around the late fourteenth century. 
      Artists in Europe created the first playing cards, which were used for games, and featured four different suits. 
      These suits were similar to what we still use today  staves or wands, discs or coins, cups, and swords. 
      After a decade or two of using these, in the mid-1400s, Italian artists began painting additional cards, heavily illustrated, to add into the existing suits.

      <br/>
      These trump, or triumph, cards were often painted for wealthy families. 
      Members of the nobility would commission artists to create for them their own set of cards, featuring family members and friends as the triumph cards.
      A number of sets, some of which still exist today, were created for the Visconti family of Milan, which counted several dukes and barons among its numbers.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Because not everyone could afford to hire a painter to create a set of cards for them,
      for a few centuries, customized cards were something only a privileged few could own. 
      t wasn't until the printing press came along that playing card decks could be mass-produced for the average game-player.
